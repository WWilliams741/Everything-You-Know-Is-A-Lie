# Everything You Know Is A Lie

General topics/points of interest for the talk:
- Introducing myself and background (credentials, deep thirst for knowledge and learning programming at the beginning of my career)
- Annoyance with trying to implement what I learned in school with what I was actually doing (Big O Notation failed?, Standard containers were slow and harder to work with?, Lots of boilerplate to get things to work? What gives?)
- Trying to understand the hardware and diving into the implementation details (what actually matters on the job - ignore this at your peril)
- The videos that changed everything ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1KNDmOYqA and Mike Acton's talk below)
- Data Oriented Design (Mike Acton's legendary talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc )
- Everything I knew in school I had to throw away, except the basics (frameworks, OOP mindset/architecture, self-justifying managerialism architectures, Big O Notation abstract computer thinking, etc.)
- Getting into the Jai closed Beta (Jonathan Blow's memory management paper blew me away: https://github.com/WWilliams741/Everything-You-Know-Is-A-Lie/blob/main/resources/Jonathan_Blow_on_memory_management.txt)
- What programming should be about: Data, Inputs, Outputs, Transformations, caring about the memory of your program, deep architectural exploration and discussion, from scratch/organic approaches, deep domain knowledge, etc.
- What programming should NEVER be about: CLEAN Code (and other crappy idioms and "design patterns"), overemphasizing the code above what it does, Individual Element Thinking (OOP, RAII, Borrow Checker, ARC, Garbage Collection), UML Diagrams, using frameworks, "Modeling", Filling out tax forms, etc. Basically, unlearn how to think like a manager and start thinking like an engineer (respect the hardware, and stop being a Gnostic programmer -> quite trying to escape due to poor environmental incentive structures)
- Software engineering is not, primarily, about "selling" the latest thing, or identifying with a language, but about producing real results with actual metrics to back them up (hard practicality - NOT rhetoric)
- A simple video helping to explain the above two topics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzc3HcIgXis
- Find a small company of 50 - 200 employees and stay in companies like those (less managerialism, avoid Conway's nightmare, and gives you actual freedom to do from scratch/organic programming).
- If you do all of this you'll always have a job, regardless of the language you use



Given everything that I know now, I would NOT have gone to college and would have skipped it and gone straight to learning what I know now. There are some useful things in college, like learning the basics and writing some code, even networking as needed, but beyond that you have to unlearn a lot of things. The job market is also not getting any better, so make yourself invaluable.
